### Usage of "chưa" at the End of a Sentence

**Function**:
- "Chưa" is used at the end of a sentence to form questions that ask whether an action has been completed or not. It serves as an equivalent to the English word "yet" in this context.

### Sentence Structure

   - **Example**: Bạn chưa ăn cơm chưa?
   - **English Translation**: Have you not eaten yet?

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Affirmative Questions**:
   - In an affirmative question, "chưa" is used to check if an action has already occurred. The sentence typically starts with the subject, followed by "đã" (which indicates past tense), the verb, the object, and ends with "chưa."
   - **Example**: Bạn đã đọc sách này chưa?
     - **Bạn**: you (subject)
     - **đã**: already (adverb indicating past action)
     - **đọc**: read (verb)
     - **sách này**: this book (object)
     - **chưa**: yet (placed at the end to form the question)

2. **Negative Questions**:
   - In a negative question, "chưa" can also be used before the verb to emphasize that the action has not been done yet and then placed at the end of the sentence to form the question.
   - **Example**: Bạn chưa ăn cơm chưa?
     - **Bạn**: you (subject)
     - **chưa**: not yet (adverb indicating incompleteness)
     - **ăn**: eat (verb)
     - **cơm**: rice/meal (object)

2. **Formal Contexts**:

   - **Example**: Ông đã ký hợp đồng chưa? (Have you signed the contract yet?)

3. **Expressing Expectation**:
   - Often used when there is an expectation that the action should have been completed.
   - **Example**: Em đã học bài chưa? (Have you studied yet?)

### Nuances and Subtleties

- **Tone of Voice**: The tone of voice when using "chưa" can imply curiosity, expectation, or even mild impatience.
- **Context**: The context of the conversation will influence the interpretation of the question. For instance, "Bạn đã ăn chưa?" can simply be a casual inquiry or a prompt for someone to eat.

- **Breakdown**:

  - **chưa**: yet (question marker at the end)

In summary, "chưa" is placed at the end of a sentence in Vietnamese to form questions that inquire about the completion of an action.
